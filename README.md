# Wheel-Project

Display a list of wheels with UI

# Instructions

1. Convert the attached “layout.jpg” to HTML without using any html framework like (bootstrap,
   w3css etc.). The assets are shared in an image zip and use dummy content.
2. Keep container maximum size of “1152px X 720px”. Layout should be vertical center position.
3. Slider functionality should be enabled without using any plugin (as per design).
4. Zoom functionality – by default all wheel images should be in normal state. On click, an active
   wheel should be zoomed smoothly as per design.
5. While clicking left/right arrow, an active state will be inactive (zoom to normal state) and then
   move accordingly.
6. If slide reached the beginning/end, the left/right side arrow should be disabled (unable to click)
